# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will extend the existing notification system to support SMS notifications via phone numbers. Currently, the system only supports email notifications when monitors detect pattern changes. Users should be able to configure phone numbers as notification channels to receive SMS alerts alongside or instead of email notifications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add phone numbers as notification channels when creating a new monitor, so that I can receive SMS alerts when patterns are found or lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new monitor THEN the system SHALL provide an option to add phone number notifications
2. WHEN a user enters a phone number THEN the system SHALL validate the phone number format
3. WHEN a user submits a monitor with phone notifications THEN the system SHALL store the phone number in the notification_channels array
4. IF a phone number is invalid THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN a user provides both email and phone notifications THEN the system SHALL support both channels simultaneously

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit existing monitors to add or remove phone number notification channels, so that I can update my notification preferences without recreating monitors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing an existing monitor THEN the system SHALL display current phone notification channels
2. WHEN editing a monitor THEN the system SHALL allow adding new phone number channels
3. WHEN editing a monitor THEN the system SHALL allow removing existing phone number channels
4. WHEN saving monitor changes THEN the system SHALL validate all phone numbers before updating
5. IF phone number validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent saving and show error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive SMS notifications when my monitors detect pattern changes, so that I can be alerted immediately via text message.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a monitor detects a pattern match THEN the system SHALL send SMS notifications to all configured phone numbers
2. WHEN a monitor loses a pattern THEN the system SHALL send SMS notifications to all configured phone numbers
3. WHEN a monitor encounters an error THEN the system SHALL send SMS notifications to all configured phone numbers
4. WHEN sending SMS notifications THEN the system SHALL include monitor name, pattern status, and website URL
5. IF SMS delivery fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure and mark notification status as failed
6. WHEN SMS is successfully sent THEN the system SHALL log the notification with "sent" status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see SMS notifications in my notification history, so that I can track all alerts sent to my phone numbers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing notification history THEN the system SHALL display SMS notifications alongside email notifications
2. WHEN displaying SMS notifications THEN the system SHALL show a phone icon to distinguish from email notifications
3. WHEN viewing notification details THEN the system SHALL show the phone number that received the SMS
4. WHEN SMS delivery fails THEN the system SHALL display the failure status in the notification history
5. WHEN filtering notifications THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by channel type (email, SMS)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want phone number validation and formatting, so that I can be confident my SMS notifications will be delivered correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entering a phone number THEN the system SHALL accept international format (+1234567890)
2. WHEN entering a phone number THEN the system SHALL accept US domestic format (123-456-7890, (123) 456-7890)
3. WHEN a phone number is entered THEN the system SHALL normalize it to international format for storage
4. IF a phone number format is invalid THEN the system SHALL display format requirements
5. WHEN displaying phone numbers THEN the system SHALL show them in a user-friendly format

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want SMS delivery to be reliable and cost-effective, so that users receive timely notifications without excessive costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending SMS notifications THEN the system SHALL use a reliable SMS service provider
2. WHEN SMS delivery fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN multiple SMS notifications are queued THEN the system SHALL respect rate limits to avoid service throttling
4. IF SMS service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade and log errors
5. WHEN SMS costs exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate safeguards
